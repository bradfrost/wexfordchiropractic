  <h1>What is Nutrition Response Testing? </h1>
 <p class="quote">&quot;I would like to tell everyone to have only one visit with Dr. Vactor
  and you'll have more. Dr. Vactor is a caring, knowledgeable doctor. He takes
  great pride in caring for each individual person. I would recommend Dr. Vactor
  for yourself, first, then for your whole family. He has also helped my children
  feel better with a nutrition program designed for them.&quot;<br />
   <span class="name">-S.J. </span></p> 
 <p>Nutrition Response Testing is a precise scientific designed to analyze your
    body's nutritional needs and then supplement them. Nutrition Response Testing
    determines nutritional needs by studying the body's own neurological reflexes
    to energy centers on the surface of the body. By analyzing these reflexes
    we can conclude exactly what nutritional supplements the body needs for optimum
    health.</p>
  <p>In medical practice there are two key parts: the diagnosis (identifying
    and/or naming the &quot;disease&quot; - but we also have two parts: the analysis
    and the personalized healthier improvement program (using designed clinical
    nutrition).</p>
  <p>Simply put, first we do an analysis and then we design a natural health improvement
  program to help you handle what we find in our analysis.</p>
<h2>Nutritional Response Testing in Wexford, Gibsonia, Pittsburgh, Pine or Marshall Townships</h2>
<p>Nutrition Response Testing is a study of how the different points on the surface
  of the body relate to the state of health and to the flow of energy in each
  and every organ and function of the body. Since the human anatomy has not changed
  significantly in thousands of years, the utilization of these specific points
  is very relevant and useful because of their accuracy. </p>
<p>Each Nutrition response testing reflex represents a specific organ, tissue,
  or function and indicates the effect that energy (or lack thereof) is having
  on the body. By testing the Nutrition Response Testing reflexes, we have a
  system of monitoring your body at each visit. It has proven to be extremely
  accurate clinically and we are able to predict, with certainty, what is needed
  and wanted by the body to get you to the next stage of improved health!</p>
<p><strong>Why is the person who referred you feeling better? </strong>We did
  a Nutrition Response Testing analysis for him or her. We found the &quot;active&quot;
  reflexes and then made specific nutritional recommendations to help the body
  return to a better state of health. </p>
<h2>Personalized Health Improvement Program</h2>
<p>Let's say the liver or kidney reflexes are active. Then what? Our next step
  is to test specific, proven, highest-quality nutritional formulas against those
  weak areas and find out which bring the reflexes back to strength.</p>
<p>Decades of clinical experience tell us that when we have found the correct
  nutritional supplements, as indicated by this procedure, we accomplish the
  most important first step. We work out a highly personalized nutritional supplement
  schedule and correct the underlying deficiency or imbalance that caused the
  reflex to be active in the first place. It's that simple! </p>
<p>In medicine, the medical doctor makes a diagnosis and then uses drugs or surgery
  to attack or suppress the symptom or surgically remove the offending organ
  or part. In Nutritional Response Testing we use <strong>Designed Clinical Nutrition </strong>to
  correct the cause of the problem. The body can regain the ability to correct
  itself. </p>
<h2>Designed Clinical Nutrition Wexford, Gibsonia, Pittsburgh, Pine or Marshall Townships</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a Designed Clinical Nutrition  in the Wexford, Gibsonia, Pittsburgh, Pine or Marshall Townships area please call the Wexford Chiropractic Centre at 724-935-1610 </p>
<p> Designed Clinical Nutrition is not over-the-counter vitamins.
  Over-the-counter vitamins are pharmaceutically engineered chemical fractions
  of vitamin structures reproduced in a laboratory. They are not &quot;whole food&quot;
  and the body does not actually recognize these as anything vaguely beneficial
  (to put it mildly). Because they are not made from whole foods, over-the-counter
  vitamins lack the essential synergistic elements normally present in whole
  foods. </p>
<p>Designed Clinical Nutrition is whole food in a tablet, capsule or powder,
  concentrated in a vacuum cold-process system that preserves all of the active
  enzymes and vital components that make it work. These real food supplements
  have been designed to match the needs of the body, as determined by the positive
  response in the Nutrition Response Testing reflexes. These are nutrients you
  are simply not getting, or not assimilating, in your current diet. </p>
<h2>The Steps Summed Up </h2>
<p>1. Through an analysis of your body's reflexes, we help you determine the
  exact nutrients you need to supplement your diet in order to bring about better
  health.</p>
<p>2. We make these highly concentrated, therapeutic formulations available to
  you in tablets, capsules, or powdered form to supplement your current diet.
  That's why they are called &quot;food supplements.&quot; </p>
<p>3. Depending on your individual situation, we may also require you make some
  specific changes in your diet and eating habits. These requirements will bring
  about the best possible results. </p>
<h2>The Technology Behind Nutritional Response Testing </h2>
<p>Having been designed through decades of clinical use on tens of thousands
  of patients from many backgrounds, you can be assured that Nutrition Response
  Testing is capable of evaluating and solving your health concerns. </p>
<p>Very much like a combination lock, you must use the right numbers in the right
  sequence to open the lock. By following the correct sequence as revealed through
  Nutritional Response Testing analysis, we can determine the correct food supplements
  for you so your body can get well and stay that way. </p>
<h2>Many people we see in our practice have eaten themselves into their current
  state of ill-health&mdash; we can restore your health.</h2>
<p>Many people we see in our practice have eaten themselves into their current
  state of ill-health&mdash; to one degree or another. The deficiencies or imbalances
  lead to a breakdown in resistance, or immunity, and a loss of the ability to
  cope with environmental stresses (chemical, microscopic, etc.). The good news
  is that it is possible to reverse the process!</p>
<p><strong>It is possible to restore your health. </strong>What could be more
  natural? What could be more correct? Each cell, tissue and organ in your body
  is in the process of replacing itself every day, month, and year. The health
  of each organ is dependent on making the correct nutrients available to upgrade
  the health of your body at a cellular level. Nutrition Response Testing tells
  you when and what to use to bring about these desired results. </p>
<p>In the end you are the only one responsible for your own condition. With our
  guidance we feel that if you are a 
  Nutritional Response Testing case, your chances of greatly improving your health
  can be 90% or better. </p>
<p>If our analysis confirms that you are a Nutrition Response Testing/clinical
  nutrition case, then nothing else will ever come close to what you can achieve
  using Nutrition Response Testing. </p>
<p>We wish you the best of luck in your quest to take back full responsibility
  for your health. You can count on us to do everything in our power to help
  you achieve your health objectives and to help you achieve a happier, healthier
  life. May you never feel the same again!  	</p>
